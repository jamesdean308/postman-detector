# postman-detector
Prototype OpenCV proof of concept program for detecting humans wearing particular coloured clothes(yellow). I intend for this to run on a TIAGo bot and have it compete in robotics competitions 

## run command
`$ python real_time_postman_detection.py --prototxt MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt.txt --model MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel`
